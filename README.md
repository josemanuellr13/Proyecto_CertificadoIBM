# Welcome to my IBM Front-End Developer Project
Designed and developed by José Manuel López. 

## Project Overview
This project showcases the skills and expertise of José Manuel López as a Front-End Developer. The application is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This powerful combination of technologies allows for the seamless development of full-stack web applications.
